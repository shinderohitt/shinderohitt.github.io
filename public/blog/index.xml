      <description>What is ads? In an ad system, there are three main entities. A business which wants to show an ad to people, the group of people who are eligible to see that ad, and the platform which ties both the parties. The platform generally charges money to businesses based on the number of views, or clicks the ad gets.
Goto is a fat app, and serves many use-cases. You can order food, a ride, or pay for things, and more.</description>

      <description>Hellooo ðŸ’œ
